  Documentation is often neglected, due to the difficulties involved in
  maintaining it consistent with the underlying source code it represents. Our
  goal in this project is to help developers understand complex codebases and
  to trust the correctness of generated the documentation.  We aim to use
  techniques from static and dynamic analysis as well as symbolic execution to
  automate the process of documentation generation, requiring only access to
  the source code.
