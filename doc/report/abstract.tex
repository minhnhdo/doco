  The task of writing documentation is often neglected due to the difficulties involved in maintaining it consistent with the underlying source code it represents. This creates a lack of information that is conflicting with the obstacles faced by developers, especially when they are trying to understand unfamiliar codebases. In this paper, we present \texttt{doco}, a tool that uses techniques from static and dynamic analysis in order to provide documentation in the form of pre- and post-conditions for functions in Java programs. \texttt{doco} is often able to present the developer with interesting properties about functions, but is limited by the state of the art in program analysis tools and by the quality of the project's test suite.
