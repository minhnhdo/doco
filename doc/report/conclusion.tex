\section{Conclusion}

We have presented \texttt{doco}, an automatic documentation generation technique, which utilizes dynamic analysis and concolic execution. \texttt{doco} synthesizes interesting properties from functions and presents them as inline documentation comments to the user. This is only the first step; further work is required to increase the usability of the generated comments and of this tool.
